# üê¶ For the Birds

Welcome to **For the Birds**, an app to find bird locations across the country!

The Internet appears to lack a dedicated app that finds locations solely based on the bird populations in the area. With this app, I hope to change that. No more digging through the web to find locations to see birds‚Äîyour one-stop shop is right here! Whether you're a birder looking for wild species or just a bird lover looking for some captive ones in aviaries, there's something for everyone on this app.

## üöÄ Getting Started

The site can be accessed [here](https://for-the-birds-8be07a7e61a3.herokuapp.com/).

### üìù Instructions:

1. Click on **Sign Up** to create an account, or **Login** if you already have one.
2. You have the option to add Locations. By clicking **Add Location**, you will be able to fill out a form to create a new one. These will be visible to all users in the **Locations** section. These locations will let users know where to find good bird locations in their area, or what birds they can expect to encounter.
3. If you had an experience in a particular location you would like to share, you can click on a specific location in the **Locations** section and **Add a Review**. This will be another form you can fill out. You can also edit and delete this review, but there's a limit of one review per location.
4. You can also see your own reviews for every location you reviewed in the **My Reviews** section.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This app was made with HTML, CSS, and Python within a Django framework. 

AI was used for some design and debugging purposes, but was otherwise by and large developed by myself.

## üîú Next Steps

* A search feature, which would allow users to be able to find locations based on name, area or associated tags for easier filtering.

* An approval system to adding and modifying locations, which otherwise may be abused by users.

* Responsiveness for mobile users and other varying screen sizes.
