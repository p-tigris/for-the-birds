        <h2>This app is a hub for finding locations across the country for viewing birds. Whether you're a birder or just a bird lover,
            there's something here for everyone.</h2>

        <h2>Feel free to add locations of your own, which will be available for all to view. Don't forget to include bird species in the tags,
            so others will know what birds they can expect there!
